# Original result data for TKDE-2024-05-1097-R1

## Introduction
This repository contains the ​**original result data**​ for our manuscript "Behavior and Sublinear Algorithm for Opinion Disagreement on Noisy Social Networks" with ID ​**TKDE-2024-05-1097.R1**. 

There is a presentation error in columns ​**7-9​**  of table Ⅲ and in columns ​**6-8​**  of table Ⅳ. This led to inconsistencies between the reported precision epsilon ($\epsilon$) values and algorithm running times that contradict established theoretical results.

We sincerely apologize for this oversight. This upload provides verifiable evidence that our original experimental results were valid and correct before the first round revision response.

## 🔍 Verification Instructions
The attached ZIP file (`data result.zip`) contains two original data result files:
1. `model_summary_test1.toml`
2. `realistic_summary_test1.toml`

​**To verify our original results are valid and correct before R1 response submitted:​**​
1. ​**Download the ZIP file directly**​ from GitHub to local (do not use cloud drive with version-controlled).
2. ​**Open the ZIP locally**​ without recompressing or modifying.
3. ​**Check file timestamp metadata**​ in local file system.

The following ​**screenshot​** shows the timestamps displayed in the file system, indicating that the last modified time of the original data result file is 2/26/2025, which is earlier than the submission time of the response on 2/27/2025.
